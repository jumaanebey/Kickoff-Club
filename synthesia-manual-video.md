Welcome to Kickoff Club! Learn football the easy way. 

In this ninety-second video, you'll master how downs work. 

A down is simply one attempt to move the ball forward. Teams get four downs to move ten yards. 

If they succeed, they get four fresh attempts. It's like getting extra lives in a video game!

Third down is crunch time - this is when teams get creative with trick plays and quick passes. You'll feel the tension!

Fourth down means decision time. Teams usually punt to play it safe. But sometimes they go for it! Or try a field goal. The crowd goes wild because everyone knows this is do-or-die.

That's it! Four tries, ten yards. Now when someone says "third and long", you'll know exactly why everyone's holding their breath.

Keep learning with Kickoff Club - where we make football fun and easy to understand!
