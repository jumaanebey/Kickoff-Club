## Section 1: What is a Down? (0:03-0:12)

### Key Concept
A "down" is just ONE attempt to move the football forward. Teams get exactly FOUR downs to move TEN yards.

### Visual Elements
- Animated football field (top-down view)
- Highlight 10-yard distance
- Show "DOWN = ONE PLAY ATTEMPT" badge
- Simple graphic: "4 TRIES ‚Üí 10 YARDS"

### Narration
"Here's the deal: a 'down' is just one attempt to move the football forward. Teams get exactly four downs to move ten yards. That's it. Think of it like having four tries to walk across your living room."

### Key Visual
- Football field with glowing 10-yard zone
- Counter showing "1 of 4 tries"

---

## Section 2: First Down Explained (0:12-0:26)

### Key Concept
"1st & 10" means: first attempt, need ten yards. Getting those 10 yards = fresh set of downs (like extra lives in a video game)

### Visual Elements
- Scoreboard graphic showing "1st & 10"
- Animated yard marker moving 10 yards
- Success animation: "FIRST DOWN!" celebration
- Reset counter: "1st & 10" (NEW SET)

### Narration
"When you see '1st & 10' on screen, it means: first attempt, need ten yards. If they get those ten yards before using up all four tries, boom - they get four fresh attempts. It's like getting extra lives in a video game."

### Data Points to Display
- 1st & 10 = First down, 10 yards to go
- Success = New 1st & 10 (reset the counter)

---

## Section 3: Second & Third Down (0:26-0:40)

### Key Concept
If they don't get 10 yards in one try, it becomes 2nd down, then 3rd down. 3rd down is CRUNCH TIME.

### Visual Elements
- Example progression: "1st & 10" ‚Üí gain 3 yards ‚Üí "2nd & 7"
- Show another play: gain 4 yards ‚Üí "3rd & 3"
- Highlight 3rd down with red/urgent colors
- Icons: football (run play) vs. football spiral (pass play)

### Narration
"If they don't get 10 on the first try, it becomes 2nd down. If still short, 3rd down ‚Äî this is crunch time! Coaches get creative - quick passes, trick plays, whatever it takes. You'll feel the tension."

### Key Examples
- 2nd & 5: Need 5 more yards
- 3rd & 7: Need 7 yards - HIGH PRESSURE
- Show crowd excitement meter rising

---

## Section 4: Fourth Down Decision (0:40-0:58)

### Key Concept
4th down = Decision time. Three main options: PUNT, GO FOR IT, or FIELD GOAL

### Visual Elements
- Three doors/options visual:
  - Door 1: PUNT (kick it away safely)
  - Door 2: GO FOR IT (try to convert)
  - Door 3: FIELD GOAL (if close enough)
- Decision tree graphic
- Stadium crowd going wild animation

### Narration
"4th down? Decision time. Teams usually punt - kick it away safely. But sometimes they go for it anyway! Or try a field goal. The crowd goes wild because everyone knows: this is do-or-die."

### Visual Strategy
- Show risk/reward meter for each option
- Display when each choice makes sense

---

## Section 5: Reading Down & Distance (0:58-1:12)

### Key Concept
Quick rule: Read the notation to predict the play

### Visual Elements
- Scoreboard zoom-ins
- Examples with predictions:
  - "3rd & 2" ‚Üí expect short run or quick pass
  - "4th & 12" ‚Üí expect punt or desperation pass
- Color coding: Green (manageable), Yellow (difficult), Red (very hard)

### Narration
"Quick rule: read down and distance. '3rd & 2' means it's 3rd down and they need 2 yards ‚Äî expect a short run or quick pass. '4th & 12'? You'll usually see a punt or long play."

### Helpful Tips Box
- Short distance (1-3 yards) = Usually run
- Medium distance (4-7 yards) = Could be either
- Long distance (8+ yards) = Usually pass

---

## Section 6: Mental Model & Recap (1:12-1:30)

### Key Concept
Simple mental model to remember: 4 tries to move 10 yards. Every play is working toward that goal.

### Visual Elements
- Clean diagram: "START ‚Üí 10 YARDS ‚Üí REPEAT"
- Summary card with key points:
  - ‚úì 4 downs to gain 10 yards
  - ‚úì Success = new set of downs
  - ‚úì 4th down = decision time
  - ‚úì Read the scoreboard to predict plays

### Narration
"That's it! Four tries, ten yards. Now when someone says '3rd and long', you'll know exactly why everyone's holding their breath. See? You're already getting it."

### Closing Hook
"You just learned how downs work! That wasn't so scary, right? Keep the momentum going - there's so much more to discover."
