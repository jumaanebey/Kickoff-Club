### Introduction (0:00-0:15)
Ever wonder how the NFL season actually works? Or how teams make it to the Super Bowl? Let's break down the entire NFL year — from kickoff to championship — in about two minutes.

### Regular Season Structure (0:15-0:45)
The NFL has 32 teams split into two conferences: the AFC and NFC. Each conference has 4 divisions with 4 teams each.

During the regular season, every team plays 17 games over 18 weeks — they get one week off, called a "bye week," to rest and recover.

Most games happen on Sundays, but you'll also see primetime games on Thursday and Monday nights. The regular season runs from early September through early January.

Your record during these 17 games determines if you make the playoffs — and what seed you get.

### Making the Playoffs (0:45-1:10)
Only 14 of the 32 teams make the playoffs — 7 from each conference.

Here's how it works:
- The 4 division winners automatically qualify
- The 3 teams with the best records among non-winners get "wild card" spots

Teams are seeded 1 through 7 based on their record. Higher seeds get home field advantage, which is huge — playing in front of your home crowd with familiar conditions.

### Playoff Format (1:10-1:35)
The playoffs are single elimination — lose once and you're done.

It's a 4-round tournament:
1. **Wild Card Round** — Seeds 2 through 7 play. The #1 seed gets a bye and waits.
2. **Divisional Round** — The winners face the top seeds
3. **Conference Championships** — The final two teams in each conference battle for the right to go to the Super Bowl
4. **Super Bowl** — AFC champion vs NFC champion

### The Super Bowl (1:35-1:55)
The Super Bowl is the NFL championship game — and it's the biggest sporting event in America. Held on the first Sunday in February at a neutral site chosen years in advance.

Over 100 million people watch it. Commercials cost $7 million for 30 seconds. The winner gets the Lombardi Trophy and eternal glory.

### Wrap-Up (1:55-2:10)
So to recap:
- 17 regular season games determine your playoff seed
- 14 teams make the playoffs — 7 per conference
- Single elimination playoffs lead to the Super Bowl
- The season runs from September to February

Now you know the full NFL journey from Week 1 to championship Sunday!
