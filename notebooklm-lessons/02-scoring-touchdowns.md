## Section 1: Getting Into The End Zone (0:03-0:18)

### Key Concept
A touchdown happens when the BALL crosses the goal line - not the player's body, just the ball.

### Visual Elements
- Animated football crossing white goal line
- Close-up: ball breaking the plane
- "BALL BREAKS PLANE = TOUCHDOWN" graphic
- Slow-motion TD celebrations

### Narration
"A touchdown happens when any part of the ball crosses the goal line while your team has possession. It doesn't matter if the player's body is in - only the ball needs to break the plane of that white line."

### Key Visual
- Side view of goal line with ball breaking the plane
- Highlight the exact moment TD is scored

## Section 2: The 6-Point Rule (0:18-0:35)

### Key Concept
Touchdowns = 6 points (NOT 7). That 7th point comes from a separate extra point attempt.

### Visual Elements
- Scoreboard animation: +6 TOUCHDOWN
- Then: +1 EXTRA POINT
- Final tally: 7 total points
- Math breakdown visual

### Narration
"Touchdowns are worth exactly 6 points, not 7. That 7th point everyone talks about? That's separate - it comes from the extra point attempt that happens right after every touchdown."

### Data Points
- TOUCHDOWN = 6 points (always)
- EXTRA POINT = +1 (separate play)
- TOTAL = 7 points (most common)

---

## Section 3: Bonus Round Choices (0:35-0:58)

### Key Concept
After every TD, teams choose: kick for 1 point (easy) or go for 2 points (harder)

### Visual Elements
- Split screen showing both options
- Left: Extra point kick (kicker, uprights, easy success)
- Right: 2-point conversion (run/pass play into end zone)
- Success rates for each displayed

### Narration
"After every touchdown, teams get one play from the 2-yard line. They can kick an extra point - almost automatic, worth 1 point - or try a 2-point conversion by running or passing it in. Harder, but worth 2 points."

### Statistical Graphics
- Extra Point success rate: ~94%
- 2-Point Conversion success rate: ~48%
- Risk vs. Reward visualization

---

## Section 4: Strategic Thinking (0:58-1:18)

### Key Concept
Most teams take the safe 1-point kick, but late-game situations demand going for 2.

### Visual Elements
- Game clock showing final minutes
- Score scenarios: "Down by 8? Need 2 to have a chance!"
- Decision tree: Safe kick vs. Risky conversion
- Coaching strategy diagram

### Narration
"Most teams take the safe 1-point kick to make it 7 total. But late in games, you'll see desperate teams go for 2 to tie or take the lead. It's risk vs reward in its purest form."

### When to Go For 2
- Down by 2 late in game (tie it up)
- Down by 8 (one TD + 2-pt could tie)
- Analytics say go for it early
- Momentum plays

---

## Section 5: Quick Recap (1:18-1:30)

### Key Concept
Simple formula: TD (6) + Choice (1 or 2) = 7 or 8 points

### Visual Elements
- Clean formula graphic
- Summary card:
  ‚úì Ball crosses goal line = 6 points
  ‚úì Then choose bonus attempt
  ‚úì Kick for 1 (safe) or go for 2 (risky)
  ‚úì Strategy depends on score/time

### Narration
"Remember: touchdown equals 6 points, then you choose your bonus. Most go for the easy extra point, but smart coaches know when to risk it all for 2."
