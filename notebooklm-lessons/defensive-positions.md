## Script

### Introduction (0:00-0:12)
Now that you know the offensive positions, let's flip the script and meet the defense — the 11 players trying to stop the offense from scoring. Let's break down each position and how they work together.

### Defensive Line (0:12-0:35)
First up: the **defensive line**, or DL.

These are the big guys right at the front, usually 3 or 4 of them. They have two main jobs:
- Rush the quarterback on passing plays — trying to sack them before they can throw
- Stop running backs at the line of scrimmage

There are two types:
- **Defensive Ends** (DE) — line up on the outside, speed rushers
- **Defensive Tackles** (DT) — in the middle, built like tanks

When you see a QB get sacked, it's usually a defensive lineman breaking through.

### Linebackers (0:35-1:00)
Next level up: **linebackers**, or LBs.

They're the middle layer of the defense, usually 3 or 4 of them standing a few yards back from the line. Think of them as the Swiss Army knives of defense:
- Cover running backs and tight ends
- Help stop running plays
- Rush the quarterback on blitzes
- Drop back into pass coverage

They need to be fast enough to cover and strong enough to tackle. The best linebackers can do it all.

### Cornerbacks (1:00-1:20)
Now the **cornerbacks**, or CBs.

These are the speed demons on defense — usually 2 or 3 of them. Their main job is simple but really hard:
- Cover wide receivers one-on-one
- Defend against pass attempts
- Break up passes or intercept them

They need elite speed and agility to keep up with the fastest offensive players. When you see a receiver blanketed with no separation, that's great cornerback play.

### Safeties (1:20-1:42)
Finally, **safeties** — the last line of defense.

There are usually 2 safeties:
- **Free Safety** (FS) — covers deep passes, prevents big plays
- **Strong Safety** (SS) — helps with run support, covers tight ends

They're the insurance policy. If everyone else misses a tackle or gets beat, the safeties are there to clean it up. When you see a receiver get tackled right after a catch, it's often a safety coming downhill.

### The Three Levels (1:42-1:55)
Think of defense in three levels:
1. **Defensive line** (0-2 yards) — Rush and stop runs
2. **Linebackers** (3-8 yards) — Middle coverage and run support
3. **Secondary** (8+ yards) — CBs and safeties protecting deep

All three levels have to work together to shut down the offense.

### Wrap-Up (1:55-2:08)
Quick recap:
- **DL** rushes the QB and stops runs up front
- **LB** covers the middle and does a bit of everything
- **CB** locks down receivers and defends passes
- **S** provides deep help and run support

Now you know both sides of the ball! Defense wins championships, and now you know why.
