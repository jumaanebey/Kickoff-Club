### Step 2: Upload Your First Lesson

**For your first video, start with:** `01-how-downs-work.md`

1. **Click "Add source"** button (or drop zone)
2. **Select "Upload"**
3. **Choose file:** Navigate to `/Downloads/kickoff-club-v2/notebooklm-lessons/01-how-downs-work.md`

**What you'll see:**
- Document appears in "Sources" list on left
- NotebookLM displays a summary of the content
- "Studio" panel appears on right side

---

### Step 3: Generate Video Overview

This is where the magic happens!

1. **Look at the right panel** labeled "Notebook Studio"
2. **Find the tile:** "Video Overview" (with a video icon)

**Optional - Customize with Steering Prompt:**
Before clicking "Create", you can click "Customize" to add instructions like:
```
Focus on visual explanations and animations.
Use the brand voice: "Love the vibe. Learn the game."
Target complete football beginners.
Keep it energetic and encouraging.
```

4. **Click "Generate"** (bottom right)

**What happens next:**

3. Generate new video overview
4. Repeat for all 7 lessons

**Option B: Separate notebook per lesson** (recommended for organization)

## üé® Customization Tips

### Using Steering Prompts

Add these instructions when generating videos:

**For beginners (lessons 1-3):**
```
This is for complete football beginners. Use simple analogies
and everyday examples. Keep tone friendly and encouraging.
Brand voice: "Love the vibe. Learn the game."
```

**For intermediate (lessons 4-7):**
```
Target viewers who understand basics and want deeper strategy.
Use game scenarios and coaching perspectives.
Maintain the encouraging, inclusive tone.
```

**For visual emphasis:**
```
Focus heavily on visual explanations with diagrams,
field graphics, and animated examples.
Show don't just tell.
```

## ‚ö° Pro Tips & Troubleshooting

### Making Videos Shorter

If you want closer to 90-second videos:

1. **Create a "Quick Version" document:**
   - Copy just the Opening Hook and 2-3 key sections
   - Remove detailed examples
   - Keep only essential narration

2. **Upload the abbreviated version** to NotebookLM
3. **Generate video** - should be ~3-4 minutes instead of 7-8

### Improving Video Quality

**For better narration:**
- Write clear, conversational sentences
- Avoid complex punctuation
- Use short paragraphs
- Include pronunciation guides for technical terms

**For better visuals:**
- Be specific in visual descriptions
- Mention colors, layouts, graphics
- Reference charts, diagrams, comparisons
- Include data points and statistics

### If Video Doesn't Generate

**Common issues:**
1. **Document too large:** Break into smaller sections
2. **Network issue:** Refresh and try again
3. **Format problem:** Ensure markdown file is properly formatted
4. **Content restrictions:** Remove any problematic content

**Solution:** Try uploading a simpler test document first to verify it works
