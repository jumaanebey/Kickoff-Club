2. Play continues to completion
3. Refs confer and announce
4. Penalty enforced or declined

## Section 2: Common 5-Yard Penalties (0:15-0:30)

### Key Concept
Minor violations cost 5 yards - these are the "parking tickets" of football

### Visual Elements
- Split screen showing three common fouls:
  - FALSE START (offense moves early)
  - OFFSIDE (defense crosses line early)
  - DELAY OF GAME (taking too long)
- 5-yard measurement animation

### Narration
"False start - offense moves before the snap. Offside - defense crosses the line early. Delay of game - taking too long to start a play. These are minor violations that cost 5 yards."

### Common 5-Yard Penalties
- False Start (Offense)
- Offside (Defense)
- Delay of Game (Either team)
- Illegal Formation
- Encroachment

## Section 3: Major 10-15 Yard Penalties (0:30-0:45)

### Key Concept
Serious fouls cost MORE yards - these change games

### Visual Elements
- Holding animation (grabbing jersey illegally)
- Unnecessary roughness (late/dangerous hit)
- Pass interference (preventing catch)
- Yardage markers showing 10 and 15-yard penalties

### Narration
"Holding - illegally grabbing a player, costs 10 yards. Unnecessary roughness - hitting too hard or late, 15 yards. Pass interference can be huge - the ball moves to where the foul happened."

### Major Penalties
- **10 yards:** Holding, Illegal use of hands
- **15 yards:** Unnecessary roughness, Facemask, Unsportsmanlike conduct
- **Spot foul:** Pass interference (can be 30+ yards!)

## Section 4: Accept or Decline (0:45-1:00)

### Key Concept
The non-offending team CHOOSES whether to accept the penalty - strategic decision!

### Visual Elements
- Decision tree graphic:
  - Branch A: "Accept penalty ‚Üí replay down with penalty yards"
  - Branch B: "Decline penalty ‚Üí keep play result"
- Real example: Gained 20 yards, but defense was offside (5 yards)
- Smart choice: DECLINE, keep your 20!

### Narration
"Here's the twist - the team that didn't commit the penalty can decline it. If you gained 20 yards but the defense was offside for 5, you'd decline and keep your 20-yard gain. It's strategic choice."

### Strategy Tips
- Accept if penalty gives better result
- Decline if play went better than penalty
- Consider down & distance

## Section 5: Automatic First Downs (1:00-1:15)

### Key Concept
Some defensive penalties don't just add yards - they give automatic 1st downs (huge!)

### Visual Elements
- Chain crew moving sticks
- "AUTOMATIC 1ST DOWN" graphic flashing
- List of auto-first-down penalties
- Drive-extending visual (keeps offense on field)

### Narration
"Some defensive penalties don't just add yards - they give automatic first downs. Defensive holding, pass interference, roughing the passer. These keep drives alive even on 3rd & long."

### Automatic 1st Down Penalties (Defense)
- Defensive Pass Interference
- Defensive Holding
- Roughing the Passer
- Unnecessary Roughness
- Illegal Contact

**Why It Matters:** Can turn 3rd & 20 into 1st & 10!

C) Both penalties offset, replay the down
D) The play doesn't count at all
