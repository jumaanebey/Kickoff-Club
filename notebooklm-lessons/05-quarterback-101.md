## Section 1: The Play Starts Here (0:03-0:20)

### Key Concept
Every offensive play begins with the QB snap - then 2-4 seconds to decide everything

### Visual Elements
- Slow-motion snap sequence from center to QB
- Split-second timer: "2-4 SECONDS TO DECIDE"
- Three decision paths: HAND OFF | THROW | SCRAMBLE
- Pressure clock ticking down

### Narration
"Every offensive play begins with the QB receiving the snap from the center. From that moment, they have about 2-4 seconds to either hand the ball off, throw it, or scramble before the defense reaches them."

### The QB's Options
- **Hand off:** Give ball to running back (0-1 second)
- **Throw:** Pass to receiver (2-3 seconds)
- **Scramble:** Run yourself (last resort)

## Section 2: Pre-Snap Reading (0:20-0:42)

### Key Concept
QBs are solving a puzzle BEFORE the ball is snapped - counting defenders, identifying threats

### Visual Elements
- QB's eye view scanning defense
- Highlighted defenders moving pre-snap
- Thought bubbles: "8 in the box? Run won't work!"
- "AUDIBLE!" callout when QB changes the play
- Hand signal animations

### Narration
"Watch a QB before the play starts - they're scanning the defense, counting players, identifying potential blitzes. They might even change the entire play by calling an 'audible' if they see something the defense is showing."

### What QBs Look For
- How many defenders near the line?
- Is a blitz coming?
- Who's covering our best receiver?
- Should we change the play?

## Section 3: Decision Making Under Pressure (0:42-1:08)

### Key Concept
Post-snap = real-time chess in 2 seconds while 300-lb defenders rush you

### Visual Elements
- QB's vision: multiple receivers highlighted
- Pocket collapsing animation (defenders closing in)
- Decision arrows: THROW / RUN / ESCAPE
- Pressure gauge visual ramping up

### Narration
"Once the ball is snapped, QBs are reading the defense in real-time. Which receiver is getting open? Is the pocket collapsing? Should they throw it away to avoid a sack? Every decision happens in split seconds."

### Mental Checklist (in 2 seconds!)
1. Is primary receiver open?
2. Check secondary option
3. Pocket still safe?
4. Scramble or throw away?

## Section 4: Different QB Styles (1:08-1:25)

### Key Concept
Pocket passers vs. Dual-threat QBs - two paths to success

### Visual Elements
- Split screen comparison:
  - LEFT: Pocket passer (staying protected, precise throws)
  - RIGHT: Dual-threat QB (scrambling, running for yards)
- Highlight examples of each style
- Stats comparison: Passing yards vs. Rushing yards

### Narration
"Some QBs are 'pocket passers' who stay protected and throw with precision. Others are 'dual-threat' QBs who can hurt you with their legs too. Both styles can be effective, just in different ways."

### QB Styles
**Pocket Passer:**
- Stays in the pocket
- Elite arm accuracy
- Reads defenses quickly
- Limited mobility

**Dual-Threat:**
- Can run for big gains
- Extends plays with legs
- Forces defense to account for QB runs
- Dynamic playmaking

## Section 5: Quick Recap (1:25-1:30)

  ‚úì Reads defense pre-snap
  ‚úì Decides in 2-4 seconds
  ‚úì Multiple styles, all effective

### Narration
