### Introduction (0:00-0:12)
Ever watch football and wonder who all those players are? Let's meet the offense — the team with the ball trying to score. We'll break down each position and what they actually do.

### The Quarterback (0:12-0:30)
Let's start with the most famous position: the **quarterback**, or QB.

The quarterback is like the field general. They touch the ball on every play and have three main jobs:
- Throw passes to receivers
- Hand the ball off to running backs
- Make quick decisions under pressure

They also call plays and can change the play at the line of scrimmage — that's called an "audible."

Think of the QB as the leader of the offense.

### Running Backs (0:30-0:50)
Next up: **running backs**, or RBs.

These are the workhorses who:
- Carry the ball on running plays
- Catch short passes out of the backfield
- Block for the quarterback when needed

They need to be fast, tough, and able to take hits. When you see someone weaving through defenders with the ball, that's usually a running back.

### Wide Receivers (0:50-1:10)
**Wide receivers**, or WRs, are the speed demons.

Their main job is to run precise routes downfield and catch passes from the quarterback. They need:
- Great hands to catch the ball
- Speed to get past defenders
- Route-running skills to get open

When you see a long bomb caught downfield, that's typically a wide receiver making the play.

### Tight Ends (1:10-1:28)
**Tight ends**, or TEs, are the versatile hybrids.

They're bigger than wide receivers but smaller than offensive linemen. They have two main roles:
- Block on running plays like a lineman
- Catch passes like a receiver

Think of them as a combo player — they need to be tough enough to block defensive ends and skilled enough to catch passes over the middle.

### Offensive Line (1:28-1:50)
Finally, the **offensive line** — the big guys up front.

There are 5 of them:
- Center (snaps the ball to the QB)
- 2 Guards (on either side of the center)
- 2 Tackles (on the outside)

Their jobs are simple but crucial:
- Protect the quarterback from pass rushers
- Create holes for running backs to run through

They're usually the biggest players on the team, and they don't get enough credit for making everything else work.

### Wrap-Up (1:50-2:05)
So that's the offense:
- **QB** leads and handles the ball every play
- **RB** carries and catches
- **WR** runs routes and catches deep passes
- **TE** blocks and catches
- **OL** protects and creates holes

All 11 players work together on every play. Now when you watch a game, you'll know exactly who's doing what!
