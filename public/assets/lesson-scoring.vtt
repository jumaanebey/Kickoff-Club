Welcome to NFL Scoring Basics!

00:03.500 --> 00:08.000
In the NFL, there are four main ways to score points.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.000
First: A touchdown is worth 6 points.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.000
You get a touchdown when you carry or catch the ball in the end zone.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.000
After a touchdown, you can kick for 1 extra point...

00:20.500 --> 00:24.000
...or try a 2-point conversion by running or passing again.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
Second: A field goal is worth 3 points.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.000
The kicker boots the ball through the uprights.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
Third: A safety is worth 2 points for the defense.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.000
This happens when the offense gets tackled in their own end zone.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.000
Fourth: Defensive touchdowns are also worth 6 points.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.000
Like when the defense intercepts and runs it back for a score.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.000
Most NFL games have scores between 14-35 points per team.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.000
High-scoring games usually mean lots of touchdowns!

00:56.500 --> 01:00.000
Low-scoring games often feature strong defenses and field goals.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.000
Now you know the four ways to score in the NFL!

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
Watch for touchdowns, field goals, safeties, and defensive scores.
