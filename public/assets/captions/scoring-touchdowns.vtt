00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A touchdown happens when any part of the ball crosses the goal line while your team has possession. It doesn't matter if the player's body is in - only the ball needs to break the plane of that white line.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Touchdowns are worth exactly 6 points, not 7. That 7th point everyone talks about? That's separate - it comes from the extra point attempt that happens right after every touchdown.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:58.000
After every touchdown, teams get one play from the 2-yard line. They can kick an extra point - almost automatic, worth 1 point - or try a 2-point conversion by running or passing it in. Harder, but worth 2 points.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Most teams take the safe 1-point kick to make it 7 total. But late in games, you'll see desperate teams go for 2 to tie or take the lead. It's risk vs reward in its purest form.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Remember: touchdown equals 6 points, then you choose your bonus. Most go for the easy extra point, but smart coaches know when to risk it all for 2.
