00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Every offensive play begins with the QB receiving the snap from the center. From that moment, they have about 2-4 seconds to either hand the ball off, throw it, or scramble before the defense reaches them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Watch a QB before the play starts - they're scanning the defense, counting players, identifying potential blitzes. They might even change the entire play by calling an 'audible' if they see something the defense is showing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Once the ball is snapped, QBs are reading the defense in real-time. Which receiver is getting open? Is the pocket collapsing? Should they throw it away to avoid a sack? Every decision happens in split seconds.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Some QBs are 'pocket passers' who stay protected and throw with precision. Others are 'dual-threat' QBs who can hurt you with their legs too. Both styles can be effective, just in different ways.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Remember: QBs are the field generals. They read, decide, and execute - all under pressure.
