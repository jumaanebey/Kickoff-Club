How Downs Work — 90s

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A down is one try to move the ball forward. Teams get four downs to go ten yards.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If it's 1st and 10, the offense has four tries starting now to gain 10 yards. Make 10 and you get a new set.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If they don't make it, it becomes 2nd down, then 3rd down — that's when coaches decide run or pass.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:58.000
On 4th down teams choose: punt it, go for it, or kick a field goal depending on yardage and situation.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Read the down and distance. 3rd & 2 means short gain needed — expect a short run or quick pass.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Mental model: four tries to move 10 yards. Every play is about gaining yards or setting up the next down.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Recap: 4 tries • Get 10 yards • 4th = punt, go for it, or field goal.
