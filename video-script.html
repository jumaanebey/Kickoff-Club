    <div class="script">
        <h2>Complete Script for Recording:</h2>
        <p>[HOOK - 0:00-0:03]<br>Want to know why they keep saying '3rd and long'? Love the vibe. Learn the game. Ninety seconds â€” you'll totally get it.<br><br>[BIG PICTURE - 0:03-0:15]<br>Here's the deal: a 'down' is just one attempt to move the football forward. Teams get exactly four downs to move ten yards. That's it. Think of it like having four tries to walk across your living room.<br><br>[FIRST DOWN MAGIC - 0:15-0:35]<br>When you see '1st & 10' on screen, it means: first attempt, need ten yards. If they get those ten yards before using up all four tries, boom - they get four fresh attempts. It's like getting extra lives in a video game.<br><br>[THE DRAMA OF 3RD DOWN - 0:35-0:55]<br>Here's where it gets exciting. If they didn't get ten yards in two tries, it's 3rd down. This is crunch time! Coaches get creative - quick passes, trick plays, whatever it takes. You'll feel the tension.<br><br>[4TH DOWN DECISIONS - 0:55-1:20]<br>4th down? Decision time. Teams usually punt - kick it away safely. But sometimes they go for it anyway! Or try a field goal. The crowd goes wild because everyone knows: this is do-or-die.<br><br>[YOU'VE GOT THIS - 1:20-1:30]<br>That's it! Four tries, ten yards. Now when someone says '3rd and long', you'll know exactly why everyone's holding their breath. See? You're already getting it.<br><br>[CLOSING - Final 5 seconds]<br>You just learned how downs work! That wasn't so scary, right? Keep the momentum going - there's so much more to discover.<br><br></p>
